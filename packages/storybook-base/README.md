## 📖 What is Storybook?

**Storybook** is an open-source tool for developing, documenting, and visually testing UI components in isolation. It allows you to:

- **Browse and interact with components** without running your full app.
- **Document components** with usage examples, props, and states.
- **Test accessibility, responsiveness, and edge cases** visually.
- **Share a living style guide** with designers and developers.

## 📦 What does this package do?

- **Aggregates stories**: Can scrape and display stories from other projects in the monorepo, making it easy to view all UI components in one place.
- **Supports documentation and testing**: Integrates with Storybook addons for docs, accessibility, and visual testing.
